# C-labyrinth-lord-fighter-generator
Designed with C, the Labyrinth Lord fighter generator allows for the random creation of a level 1 fighter.  Random functions are used to stimulate rolling of 3 six-sided dice for the abilities scores, starting wealth, hit points, etc.  As well, a seed is inserted using &lt;time>.  The generator allows for the user to save their generated fighter in a text format (txt file).
